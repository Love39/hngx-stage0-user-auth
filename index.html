                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>My interest in artistic designs began in my late teens. I'm drawn to creative expressions and visually appealing designs
                   in all spheres of life be it fashion, architure and others so when i decided to build a career in web development, 
                   choosing Front-End came as a natural pick.<br>
                   I enjoy the artistic aspect of web design and i love to create visually appealing and user friendly websites that are easy to navigate.
                   My passion for visually appealing websites made me develop interest in bringing these designs to life.<br>
                   As a front-end web developer, I like the visually satisfying result i get when i immediately see the results of my code on the User Interface.<br>
                   I enjoy building responsive web pages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>
                    For visually appealing and interactive web applications, you can <a href="https://hng.tech/hire/reactjs-developers"> Hire React.js Developers</a><br>
                    I want to be a well rounded frontend developer that can connect design and development to 
                    build appealing and user friendly websites. I also want to grow in frontend technologies.

                <h3>How HNG will help me grow in my field</h3>
                <p>A very important key to thriving in a tech career is to practice consistently by building projects.
                     At HNG internship, i will be presented with hands-on projects that will enable me to gain real world experience in
                      front-end development and also sharpen my skills. In addition to sharpening my skill, the taskes will equip me to 
                      be fully prepared to handle the role of a front-end developer.<br>
                    Also, at HNG i will be exposed to a community of skilled techies and experienced developers
                     that are ready to provide the support and help needed in my career journey. This in turn will enhance my learning experience and expand my network.<br>
                    I also hope to gain practical knowledge in UI/UX design and learn how to use other tools in
                     creating web applications.</p>
